# Rudy

Rudy is a Judy array implementation in Rust. Judy arrays are highly efficient
word-to-word or word-to-bool maps that adapt well to different data. The
reference [Judy array implementation](https://judy.sourceforge.net/) provides a
word to word map (JudyL), set of words (Judy1), string to word (JudySL) and
fixed length byte array to word map (JudyHS). Judy arrays use a compressed
256-radix trie.

The initial Rudy implementation will implement JudyL as RudyMap and Judy1 as
RudySet. Because zero sized types can be represented by a RudyMap, it will be
trivial to represent RudySet<T> as a wrapper around a RudyMap<T, ()>. Future
iterations may include JudySL and JudyHS support.

# Differences between Judy and Rudy

Rudy appears to be the first implementation to use generics in the core library.
The [judy-template](https://github.com/mpictor/judy-template) bindings for C++
allow for automatic conversion to and from words, but not use of values that
need larger storage. Using generics allows for lower memory usage for smaller
types and the usage of larger types, with possible impact to performance.
